=============
Country Order
=============

By default, countries are ordered alphabetically. However it is often the case
that a company deals frequently with a few countries in particular.

It is desirable to show these countries first in selection menus to
simplify entry.

This module allows setting sequence numbers on countries. Countries
will be sorted by sequence first, then alphabetically.
